1. Don't make yourself remember context
   * Why
     * Side projects go months or years without attention,
       you're going to forget what you were doing.
     * This adds a nice side effect: It's easy to contribute in small bursts.
   * How
     * Spend time on documentation and testing
     * Take your time
2. Spend no more than 2h at a time
   * Why?
     * You're already working a full time job.
       Pushing yourself on the weekends makes you feel bit-brained and burnt out.
     * Keeps you from caught up chasing a feature
       and leaving a mess behind you (see rule 1)
   * How
     * Set a silent timer.
       Don't try to stretch to two hours.
       Stop when you're tired / uninterested.
